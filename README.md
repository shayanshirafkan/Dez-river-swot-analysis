# 🌊 Dez River SWOT Analysis

SWOT-based hydrological analysis and visualization of the **Dez River (Iran)** — extracting **Water Surface Elevation (WSE)** and **discharge data** from SWOT River Reach products using **Python**, **GeoPandas**, and **Matplotlib**.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

This open-source project provides a Python workflow for analyzing **SWOT Level 2 HR RiverSP Reach** data over the **Dez River Basin**.  
It filters SWOT reach shapefiles based on a bounding box, extracts **WSE** and **discharge** values for each reach, and generates both analytical and geospatial visualizations — including **satellite overlays**.

This tool is ideal for hydrologists, environmental scientists, and remote sensing researchers working with SWOT river datasets.
